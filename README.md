## Introduction
The iProov Biometrics React Native SDK wraps iProov's native iOS (Swift) and Android (Java) SDKs behind a JavaScript interface for use from within your React Native iOS or Android app.

### Requirements

- React Native 0.73 and above
- iOS 13.0 and above
- Android API Level 26 (Android 8 Oreo) and above

## Registration

You can obtain API credentials by registering on the [iProov Partner Portal](https://portal.iproov.net).

## Installation

1. Add the following to your package.json file:
	
	```json
	"dependencies": {
	  "@iproov/react-native": "2.0.2"
	}
	```

2. From your React Native app directory, run:
	
	```sh
	yarn
	```

### iOS installation

1. Add an `NSCameraUsageDescription` entry to your app's Info.plist, with the reason why your app requires camera access (e.g. ‚ÄúTo iProov you in order to verify your identity.‚Äù)

2. You need to **Enable frameworks** - Cocoapods by default builds static libraries rather than frameworks. You should add the following to your Podfile:
	
	```ruby
	use_frameworks!
	```
	Please note that [Flipper](https://fbflipper.com/docs/getting-started/react-native/) does not work with `use_frameworks`, so you should remove it if you have it enabled.
	
3. In your React Native app `ios` directory, run:

	```sh
	pod install
	```	
		
	This will install all Pods and apply the above workarounds.
	
### Android installation

You must add the iProov repository URL to your `repositories` block inside the `allprojects` block in your build.gradle file:

```groovy
allprojects {
    repositories {
        maven { url 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iProov/android/master/maven/' } // Add this
    }
}
```

## Get started

Once you have a valid token (obtained via the React Native API client or your own backend-to-backend call), you can `launch()` an iProov capture and handle the callback events as follows:

```javascript
import IProov from '@iproov/react-native'
import NativeEventEmitter from 'react-native'

let options = new IProov.Options()
options.filter = {
	name: IProov.Options.LINE_DRAWING,
	style: IProov.Options.CLASSIC,
	foregroundColor: '#00000055',
	backgroundColor: '#32a852'
}

const eventEmitter = new NativeEventEmitter(IProov.IProovReactNative)

IProov.launch('wss://eu.rp.secure.iproov.me/ws', "< YOUR TOKEN >", options, eventEmitter, (event) => {
	switch(event.name) {
	
	case IProov.EVENT_CONNECTING:
	  // The SDK is connecting to the server. You should provide an indeterminate progress indicator
	  // to let the user know that the connection is taking place.
	  break
	
	case IProov.EVENT_CONNECTED:
	  // The SDK has connected, and the iProov user interface will now be displayed. You should hide
	  // any progress indication at this point.
	  break
	
	case IProov.EVENT_PROCESSING:
	  // The SDK will update your app with the progress of streaming to the server and authenticating
	  // the user. This will be called multiple times as the progress updates.
  
	  let progress = event.params.progress
	  let message = event.params.message
	  break
	
	case IProov.EVENT_CANCELED:
	  // Either the user canceled iProov by pressing the Close button at the top or
	  // the Home button (canceler == USER)
	  // Or the app canceled using Session.cancel() (canceler = APP).
	  // You should use this to determine the next step in your flow.

	  let canceler = event.params.canceler
	  break
	
	case IProov.EVENT_FAILURE:
	  // The user was not successfully verified/enrolled, as their identity could not be verified,
	  // or there was another issue with their verification/enrollment. A reason (as a string)
	  // is provided as to why the claim failed, along with a feedback code from the back-end.
  
	  let reason = event.params.reason
	  let frame = event.params.frame // Optional property containing a single Base64 encoded frame
	  break
	
	case IProov.EVENT_SUCCESS:
	  // The user was successfully verified/enrolled and the token has been validated.
   
	  let frame = event.params.frame // Optional property containing a single Base64 encoded frame
	  break

	case IProov.EVENT_ERROR:
	  // The user was not successfully verified/enrolled due to an error (e.g. lost internet connection).
	  // You will be provided with an Exception (see below).
	  // It will be called once, or never.
	  let error = event.params.error
	  let reason = event.params.reason
	  let message = event.params.message
	  break
	}
})
```

üëâ You should now familiarize yourself with the following resources:

-  [iProov Biometrics iOS SDK documentation](https://github.com/iProov/ios)
-  [iProov Biometrics Android SDK documentation](https://github.com/iProov/android)

These repositories provide comprehensive documentation about the available customization options and other important details regarding the SDK usage.

## Options

The `Options` class allows iProov to be customized in various ways. These can be specified by passing options in `IProov.launch()`.

Most of these options are common to both Android and iOS, however, some are platform-specific.

For full documentation, please read the respective [iOS](https://github.com/iProov/ios#options) and [Android](https://github.com/iProov/android#options) native SDK documentation.

A summary of the support for the various SDK options in React Native is provided below. All options can be null and any options not set will default to their platform-specific default value.

(*) Custom fonts are not currently supported and will be added in a future version of the React Native SDK.

### Filter Options

The SDK supports two different camera filters:

#### `LINE_DRAWING`

`LINE_DRAWING` is iProov's traditional "canny" filter, which is available in 3 styles: `IProov.Options.SHADED` (default), `IProov.Options.CLASSIC` and `IProov.Options.VIBRANT`.

The `foregroundColor` and `backgroundColor` can also be customized.

Example:

```javascript
var options = new IProov.Options()
options.filter = {
	name: IProov.Options.LINE_DRAWING,
	style: IProov.Options.CLASSIC,
	foregroundColor: '#00000055',
	backgroundColor: '#32a852'
}
```

> **Note**: `foregroundColor` and `backgroundColor` are only applicable to `LINE_DRAWING` filter.

#### `NATURAL`

`NATURAL` provides a more direct visualization of the user's face and is available in 2 styles: `IProov.Options.CLEAR` (default) and `IProov.Options.BLUR`.

Example:

```javascript
var options = new IProov.Options()
options.filter = {
	name: IProov.Options.NATURAL,
	style: IProov.Options.CLEAR
}
```

> **Note**: `NATURAL` is available for Liveness Assurance claims only. Attempts to use `NATURAL` for Genuine Presence Assurance claims will result in an error.

## Handling errors

IProov listener error events will contain an `error` string within the events `params` property which maps to native exceptions:

| Exception                         | iOS | Android | Description                                                                                                                      |
| --------------------------------- | :---: | :-------: | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `capture_already_active_error`   | ‚úÖ   | ‚úÖ       | An existing iProov capture is already in progress. Wait until the current capture completes before starting a new one.           |
| `network_error`                    | ‚úÖ   | ‚úÖ       | An error occurred with the video streaming process. Consult the `message` value for more information.                            |
| `camera_permission_error`           | ‚úÖ   | ‚úÖ       | The user disallowed access to the camera when prompted. You should direct the user to re-enable camera access.                   |
| `server_error`                 | ‚úÖ   | ‚úÖ       | A server-side error/token invalidation occurred. The associated `message` will contain further information about the error.      |
| `unexpected_error`        | ‚úÖ   | ‚úÖ       | An unexpected and unrecoverable error has occurred. These errors should be reported to iProov for further investigation.         |
| `unsupported_device_error`         |‚úÖ   | ‚úÖ         | Device is not supported.|
| `multi_window_unsupported_error` |     | ‚úÖ       | The user attempted to iProov in split-screen/multi-screen mode, which is not supported.                                          |
| `camera_error`                 |     | ‚úÖ       | An error occurred acquiring or using the camera. This could happen when a non-phone is used with/without an external/USB camera. |
| `face_detector_error`           |     | ‚úÖ       | An error occurred with the face detector.                                                                                        |
| `invalid_options_error`         |     | ‚úÖ       | An error occurred when trying to apply your options.                                                                             |
| `user_timeout_error`         |‚úÖ   |          | The user has taken too long to complete the claim.|




## Localization

String localization is handled by adding translations to both native components, you can do this by following the instructions of the respective platform of the native iProov SDK.<br/>
* [iProov Biometrics iOS SDK localization documentation](https://github.com/iProov/ios#localization)<br/>
* [iProov Biometrics Android SDK localization documentation](https://github.com/iProov/android#localization)

## API Client

The React Native API Client provides a convenient wrapper to call iProov's REST API v2 from a React Native app. It is a useful tool to assist with testing, debugging and demos, but should not be used in production mobile apps.

The React Native API client can be found in `ApiClient.js`.

To setup your credentials, copy `credentials.example.js` to `credentials.js` and add them to the example project.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **SECURITY NOTICE:** Use of the React Native API Client requires providing it with your API secret. **You should never embed your API secret within a production app.**

### Functionality

The React Native API Client supports the following functionality:

- `getToken()` - Get an enrol/verify token
- `enrolPhoto()` - Perform a photo enrolment (either from an electronic or optical image). The image must be provided as a base64 encoded jpeg represented as a string.
- `enrolPhotoAndGetVerifyToken()` - A convenience method which first gets an enrolment token, then enrols the photo against that token, and then gets a verify token for the user to iProov against.
- `validate()` - Validates a token, this is typically called via a backend-to-backend call to ensure that the claim was successful.
- `invalidate()` - Used to cancel (invalidate) a token. Once a token has been invalidated, it can no longer be used.

### Getting a token

The most useful thing you can do with the API Client is get a token to either enrol or verify a user, using either iProov's Genuine Presence Assurance or Liveness Assurance.

This is achieved as follows:

```javascript
import ApiClient, { CLAIM_TYPE_ENROL, ASSURANCE_TYPE_LIVENESS } from './ApiClient.js'

let apiClient = ApiClient({
  baseUrl: "https://eu.rp.secure.iproov.me/api/v2/", // Substitute URL as appropriate
  apiKey: "< YOUR API KEY >",
  secret: "< YOUR SECRET >"
});

let token = await apiClient.getToken(ASSURANCE_TYPE_LIVENESS, CLAIM_TYPE_ENROL, "name@example.com");
```

You can then launch the iProov SDK with this token.

## Sample code

For a simple iProov experience that is ready to run out-of-the-box, check out the React Native example project which also makes use of the React Native API Client.

Copy the `credentials.example.js` file to `credentials.js` and add your credentials obtained from the [iProov portal](https://portal.iproov.com/).

Once you have completed the [installation](#installation) instructions, to run the example app, you should run the following commands:

```sh
npx react-native run-android		# Run on Android
npx react-native run-ios --device	# Run on iOS
```

> NOTE: iProov is not supported on the iOS or Android simulator, you must use a physical device in order to iProov.
